<h2 align="left">What is Zencurses?</h2>

###

<p align="left">
Zencurses is originally a play on words, combining The Zen-Browser with Ncurses, which is a programming library used to create command line user interfaces. 
The need from this came entirely from myself. As I was using a custom Spicetify theme called text-something (sorry not sure), but really liked it. And because Zen is open source, I thought it would be cool to create my own custom theme based on the same theme. This is how Zencurses was created. I tried to build everything as modular as possible, such that you can edit it to your own liking, so if you don't like anything, just change it.

Of course! Just make a PR and I'll try and look at it ASAP.
